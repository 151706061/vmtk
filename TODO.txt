- avoid littering the global namespace. Move all python scripts and the *Python.so libraries in /usr/local/lib/vmtk/vmtk (at least, if not use setup.py to put them in /usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages, which would probably be much better).
Write __init__.py and put it in vmtk/vmtk. It must only contain import pypes, import vtkvmtk, import vmtkscripts.
At this point, we have to slightly change the way pypes calls the modules, prepending vmtk.
