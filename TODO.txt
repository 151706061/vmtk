- centerline splitting and grouping is not bullet-proof. It can fail in very weird situations. It would be good to review the code (and maybe lifting the tree assumption)
- branch clipping should use a connectivity criterion (region growing?) to ensure avoiding islands in strange geometries
- write filter to close holes with smooth caps (using subdivision or thin plate splines)
- write selective smoothing filter
